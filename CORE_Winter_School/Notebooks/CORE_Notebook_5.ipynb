This procedure estimates the coefficients on $W_{k,ij}$ for $k=1,...,K$ as well as individual specific degree heterogeneity parameters $A_{i}$ for $i=1,...,N$. The *dyad\\_jfe\\_logit()* function implements this estimator. By default it reports the iterated bias-corrected estimates described in the paper (but the uncorrected estimates are also returned by the function)."

    "Relative to the *tetrad\\_logit()* results, the joint estimator suggests sorting by religion and clan. In Monte Carlo experiments I have found that the joint estimator -- particularly the bias correction step -- can work very poorly in networks like the Nyakatoke one (i.e., in networks that are sparse such that many agents have only a few links). In such settings the $A_{i}$ for $i=1,...,N$ may be _very_ imprecisely estimated and this can effect the quality of the common parameter estimates as well.\n",

This suggests, that in this particular example, bias-correction may be doing more harm that good.\n",
